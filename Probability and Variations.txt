Definitions of factorial: 

(n + k)! = n! x (n + 1) x (n + 2) x ... x (m + k)
(n - k)! = n! / (n - k + 1) x ... x (n - k + k) which simplifies to n

Meaning of the difference of factorials:

(5 - 3)! = 5!  / (5 - 3 + 1) x (5 - 3 + 2) x (5 - 3 + 3) 
=  5! / 3 x 4 x 5 = 5x4x3x2x1 / 3x4x5 = 2x1 = 2


Permutations:

p of 5 positions = 5!

Variations with reps:

Variations are different from permutations. Permutation is an ordered arrangement of all or some objects in a given set. The order in which the objects are arranged matters.
In permutations, repetition isn't allowed. While in variations, repetition is allowed. 

v of n elements in p positions = n elements to the power of the p positions 
4 letter words with A,B,C = 3 elements to the power of 4 positions = 3^4 (81 variations)


Variations without reps:

v of n elements in positions without repeating an element = n! / (n - p)! 

v(n, p) = n! / (n - p)!

7 teams members for 4 positions.

v(7, 4) = 7! / (7 - 4)! = 7! / 3! = 7x5x6x4x3! / 3! = 120 x 7 = 840

5 cake flavours in 3 different tiers of the cake, the flavours can't be repeated
v(5, 3) = 5! / 2!


Combinations: the number of different ways we can pick certain elements of a set.

All the different permutations of single combination are different variations

the number of combinations are the number of variations divided by its permutations 

c of n elements in p positions is equal the v of n elements in p positions divided by the p of p positions 

c(n,p) = v(n,p) / p(p)

c(n,p) = (n! / (n - p)!) / p! = n! / (n - p)! x 1/p! = n! / p!(n - p)!


Combine 3 different maroons of the 8 we have at your disposal. 
It can't be a variation problem because: strawberry, chocolate and vanilla are the same as chocolate, vanilla and strawberry
Let's first go in the permutations

P of p = 3!
V(n, p) = (8, 3) = 8! / 5! =  8!/3!5! = 8x6x7 / 3x2 = 8x7 = 56

P of p = 8!
V(8,8) = 8! / 0! 
c = 8! / 8!x1 = 1
