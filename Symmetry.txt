C (n , p) = C(n, n - p)

as reads, the combination of n elements taken in p positions is equal to the combination of n elements taken in n elements - p positions 

as in:

C(10, 8) = C(10, 10 - 8) = C(10, 2)

Combinations with different sample spaces

Assuming I went to a restaurant that serves a three course meal,

There are 5 options for the main, 12 for the antepasto and 2 after lunch.

If I went to the restaurant every day, in how many days would I have eat every possible three course meal combination?

5 different main x 12 antepastos x 2 after lunch

10x12 = 120 that would take a total of 120 days or 24 weeks considering 5-day weeks
